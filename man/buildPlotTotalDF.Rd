\title{Build all labels in the graph}
\usage{
buildPlotTotalDF(path, geneal, ig, binVector = 1:12)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{path as returned from getPath() or a vector of two variety names which exist in ig}

\item{geneal}{the full genealogy  (in data frame format)}

\item{ig}{the graph representation of the data genealogy (in igraph format)}

\item{binVector}{vector of numbers between 1 and length(binVector), each repeated exactly once}
}
\description{
This function takes the spreadTotalDF object (from the buildSpreadTotalDF function) and the path object
as inputs. From these objects, it creates a data frame object of the text label positions for the
varieties in the path, as well as the edges only in the varieties in the path.
