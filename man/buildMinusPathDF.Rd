\title{Process the genealogy graph}
\usage{
buildMinusPathDF(path, geneal, ig, binVector = 1:12)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{path as returned from getPath() or a vector of two variety names which exist in the ig object}

\item{geneal}{the full genealogy  (in data frame format)}

\item{ig}{the graph representation of the data genealogy (in igraph format)}

\item{binVector}{vector of numbers between 1 and length(binVector), each repeated exactly once}
}
\description{
This function takes the spreadTotalDF object (from the buildSpreadTotalDF function) and the path object
as inputs. From these objects, it creates a data frame object of the label, x, and y values of all nodes
in the ful genealogy. However, the data frame object does not include the labels of the path varieties, as they
will be treated differently.
