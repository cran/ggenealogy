\title{Build data frame for path representation}
\usage{
buildPathDF(path)
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{path object representing the path between two
  vertices}
}
\description{
This function builds a dataframe of information about the
path object that can later be used for visualization. The
dataframe includes "label" (name of each variety) of each
node, "x" (the year of the variety, the x-axis value for
which the label and incoming/outgoing edges are centered),
"y" (the y-axis value, which is the index of the path,
incremented by unity), "xstart" (the x-axis position of the
outgoing edge (leaving to connect to the node at the next
largest y-value)), "xend" (the x-axis position of the
outgoing edge (connected to the node at the next largest
y-value)), "ystart" (the y-axis position of the outgoing
edge (leaving to connect to the node at the next largest
y-value), "yend" (the y-axis position of the outgoing edge
(connected to the node at the next largest y-value))).
